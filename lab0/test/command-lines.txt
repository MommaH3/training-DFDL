# MS-Windows users
#
# The above command line should also work on MS-Windows in the CMD shell, or Powershell
#
# Note: most windows CMD commands accept "/" as well as "\" in paths. Not all do. (ex: the 'type' command does not.)
# Using Powershell is recommended. Just type powershell at the cmd prompt and you are using it.
#
# Note: on MS-Windows CMD, to extend a command onto the next line use the ^ character at end of line
# Note: on Powershell, to extend a commnad onto the next line use the ` (backtick) character at end of line

#
# Try to run a TDML test

# Note that your environment variables must be setup like this:
export DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH=src:test
# MS-Windows users must use the environment variables dialog to add a
# DAFFODIL_CLASSPATH environment variable with value src\main\resources;src\test\resources
# note that is a semicolon separating the two paths.

# Use the csvHeaderEnforced.dfdl.xsd DFDL schema.

# What diagnostic message did you get back?

# but you can change the test in the csv.tdml file, to watch it fail from TDML
# test execution if you want.
